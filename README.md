## Core Requirements Verification

| Requirement | Status | Implementation |
|-------------|--------|-----------------|

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cannot connect to MongoDB | Check MONGODB_URI in `.env`, verify IP whitelist |
| CORS error in browser | Backend CORS is enabled; ensure backend runs on port 5000 |
| Port already in use | Change PORT in `.env` or kill existing process |
| Cannot find module | Run `npm install` in both directories |
| API not responding | Ensure backend is running before frontend |
